# Pre Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation to create this project is to overcome my failure fears and build not only a website as well as my knowledge.
I built this project because learning new things and an entire world of programming languages is not an easy task however, I have to believe that I am capable of creating and doing great things, such as this project.
The biggest challenge was keeping track of all commits and merging the branches in GitHub, it requires some practice, and repeating the process a few times while creating this project was definitely helpful.
While working on this project I could learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub.
